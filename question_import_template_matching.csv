Note: 
- leftItems: Comma-separated list of items for the left column
- rightItems: Comma-separated list of items for the right column

  Example: "0-2,1-0,2-3,3-1" means:
    - Left item 0 (first item) matches Right item 2 (third item)
    - Left item 1 (second item) matches Right item 0 (first item)
    - Left item 2 (third item) matches Right item 3 (fourth item)
    - Left item 3 (fourth item) matches Right item 1 (second item)
- Both columns must have the same number of items
- Each item in leftItems must have a unique match in rightItems
- The correctPairs should show shuffled/random matches, not sequential (0-0,1-1,2-2)
